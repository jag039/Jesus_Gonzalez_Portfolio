                Hello, everyone! My name is Jesus Gonzalez. I am a
                computer science major at the Univeristy of San Diego
                California. This is my portfolio website which is quite
                simple. Here you can see my experience and my projects
                very similar to a resume.    
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm on a journey of discovery, especially in the exciting 
                fields of machine learning, cybersecurity, and graphics. 
                I'm eager to dive into these areas and learn all I can. 
                Whether it's understanding the basics of AI, exploring ways 
                to keep data safe, or experimenting with graphic design 
                concepts, I'm always up for the challenge. I may not be an 
                expert yet, but I'm enthusiastic about soaking up knowledge 
                and honing my skills.
            </p>
